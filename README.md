# Mixcloud-Downloader-2
A python script to get a few (32 ? ) gigs of radioshows for the van !
The latest and greatest in a long running series.
Most public radio in the UK is trash ( except 6 Music ) , and I can't get a stable connetion whilst driving in the cotswolds, so I want to have the most recent electronic music radio shows and dj mixes on a 32gb stick to play whilst i'm driving.
This is my solution.

Requires : selenium, gecko driver, firefox, youtube-dl, linux ( developed on debian 10 and python 3.7 ish ).

This version is single threded and slow, it is possible to go faster but pyhton is a bit iffy in this regard.
It's good enough for me and probably won't cheese to many people off !
