# Mixcloud-Downloader-2
A python script to get a few gigs of radioshows for the van !
The latest and greatest in a long running series.
Most public radio in the UK is trash ( except 6 Music ) , and I can't get a stable connetion whilst driving in the cotswolds, so I want to have the most recent electronic music radio shows and dj mixes on a 32gb stick to play whilst i'm driving.
This is my solution.

Requires : seleniun, gecko driver, firefox, youtube-dl.
Initial version is slow as all hell, will attempt to add a multithereded version later.
